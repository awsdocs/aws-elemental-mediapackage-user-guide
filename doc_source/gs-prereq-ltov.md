Before you can use AWS Elemental MediaPackage, you need an AWS account and the appropriate permissions to access, view, and edit MediaPackage components\. Make sure that your system administrator has completed the following steps in [Setting up AWS Elemental MediaPackage](setting-up.md), and then return to this tutorial:
+ To create an AWS account, see [Signing up for AWS](setting-up-aws-sign-up.md)\.
+ To allow non\-administrative users access to MediaPackage, see [Creating a non\-admin IAM user](setting-up-create-non-admin-iam.md)\.
+ To allow MediaPackage to access your Amazon S3 bucket to save and retrieve the live\-to\-VOD asset, see [Allowing AWS Elemental MediaPackage to access other AWS services](setting-up-create-trust-rel.md)\.
