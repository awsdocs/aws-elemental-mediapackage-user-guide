# Logging and monitoring in AWS Elemental MediaPackage<a name="monitoring"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Elemental MediaPackage and your other AWS solutions\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch MediaPackage, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate:
+ *Amazon CloudWatch* monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real\-time\. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify\. For example, you can have CloudWatch track CPU usage or other metrics of your Amazon EC2 instances and automatically launch new instances when needed\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.
+ *Amazon CloudWatch Events* delivers a near real\-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources\. CloudWatch Events enables automated event\-driven computing, as you can write rules that watch for certain events and trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events happen\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/)\.
+ *AWS CloudTrail* captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.
+ *AWS Elemental MediaPackage access logs* provide detailed records about requests that are made to a channel\. Access logs are useful for many applications\. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits\. For more information, see [Access logging](access-logging.md)\.
+ *MediaPackage manifest update headers* indicate when the service last updated the manifest and segment sequence in workflows that don't use dynamic ad insertion\. MediaPackage includes these custom headers in playback responses\. These headers are helpful when troubleshooting issues related to stale manifests\. For more information, see [Monitoring manifest update time](monitoring-manifest-last-updated.md)\.
