# Package encryption fields<a name="endpoints-dash-encryption"></a>

Protect your content from unauthorized use through content encryption and digital rights management \(DRM\)\. AWS Elemental MediaPackage uses the [AWS Secure Packager and Encoder Key Exchange \(SPEKE\) API](https://aws.amazon.com/media/tech/speke-basics-secure-packager-encoder-key-exchange-api/) to facilitate content encryption and decryption by a DRM provider\. Using SPEKE, the DRM provider supplies encryption keys to MediaPackage through the SPEKE API\. The DRM provider also supplies licenses to supported media players for decryption\. For more information about how SPEKE is used with services and features running in the cloud, see [AWS cloud\-based architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/speke/latest/documentation/what-is-speke.html#services-architecture) in the *Secure Packager and Encoder Key Exchange API Specification guide*\.

**Note**  
To encrypt content, you must have a DRM solution provider and be set up to use encryption\. For information, see [Content encryption and DRM in AWS Elemental MediaPackage](using-encryption.md)\. 

Define the encryption values\.

1. To serve content without copyright protection, keep **No encryption** selected\.

1. To serve content with copyright protection, choose **Encrypt content** and complete the additional fields as follows:

   1. For **Resource ID**, enter an identifier for the content\. The service sends this to the key server to identify the current endpoint\. How unique you make this depends on how fine\-grained you want access controls to be\. The service does not allow you to use the same ID for two simultaneous encryption processes\. The resource ID is also known as the content ID\. 

      The following example shows a resource ID\.

      ```
      MovieNight20171126093045
      ```

   1. For **System IDs**, enter unique identifiers for your streaming protocol and DRM system\. Provide up to two IDs\. If you provide more than one system ID, enter one per line and choose **Add**\. For a list of common system IDs, see [DASH\-IF System IDs](https://dashif.org/identifiers/content_protection/)\. If you do not know your IDs, ask your DRM solution provider\.

   1. For **URL**, enter the URL of the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to your key server\. The API Gateway proxy must reside in the same AWS Region as MediaPackage\.

      The following example shows a URL\. 

      ```
      https://1wm2dx1f33.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SpekeSample/copyProtection
      ```

   1. For **Role ARN**, enter the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the IAM role that provides you access to send your requests through API Gateway\. Get this from your DRM solution provider\.

      The following example shows a role ARN\. 

      ```
      arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/SpekeAccess
      ```

   1. \(Optional\) For **SPEKE version**, select the SPEKE version that you'd like to use for encryption\. SPEKE Version 1\.0 is the legacy version that uses CPIX Version 2\.0, and supports single key encryption\. SPEKE Version 2\.0 uses CPIX Version 2\.3, and supports multiple key encryption\. For more information about using SPEKE with MediaPackage, see [Content encryption and DRM in AWS Elemental MediaPackage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/ug/using-encryption.html)\.

      If you select **SPEKE Version 2\.0**, then also choose a **Video encryption preset** and an **Audio encryption preset**\. The video and audio presets determine which content keys MediaPackage uses to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream\. For more information about these presets, see [SPEKE Version 2\.0 presets](drm-content-speke-v2-presets.md)\.

      When using SPEKE Version 2\.0, MediaPackage disables key rotation\.

   1. **Certificate ARN** â€“ \(Optional\) Enter a 2048 RSA certificate ARN to use for content key encryption\. Use this option only if your DRM key provider supports content key encryption\. If you use this and your key provider doesn't support it, the event fails\.

      To enter a certificate ARN here, you must have already imported the corresponding certificate into AWS Certificate Manager\. Then enter the certificate ARN from ACM here\. 

      For information about content key encryption, see [Preparing and managing certificates for use with content keys](drm-content-key-encryption.md)\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Key rotation interval**, enter the frequency, in seconds, of key changes for live workflows, in which content is streamed real time\. The service retrieves content keys before the live content begins streaming, and then retrieves them as needed over the lifetime of the workflow\. By default, key rotation is set to 60 seconds, which is equivalent to setting it to `60`\. To disable key rotation, set this interval to `0` \(zero\)\. 

      The following example setting causes the service to rotate keys every thirty minutes\.

      ```
      1800
      ```

      For information about key rotation, see [Understanding key rotation behavior](drm-content-key-encryption.md)\.
