# Creating a Distribution<a name="cdns-create"></a>

A distribution in Amazon CloudFront holds all information about content delivery, including where content is coming from and how it's tracked and managed\. The distribution holds origins \(where content is originating from\) and behaviors \(where content requests are routed based on specified patterns in the request\)\.

You can create a distribution automatically from the AWS Elemental MediaPackage live console, or manually from the CloudFront console\. The following sections describe each approach\.
