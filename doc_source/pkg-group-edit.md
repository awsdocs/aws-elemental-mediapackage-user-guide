Edit the packaging group to configure access control settings\.

**Note**  
You can't edit the packager group ID after the packaging group is created\. If you want to change the packaging group ID, you must create a new packaging group\.

You can use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, the AWS CLI, or the MediaPackage API to edit a packaging group's access control settings\. For information about editing a packaging group using the AWS CLI or MediaPackage API, see the [MediaPackage VOD API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage-vod/latest/apireference/packaging_groups)\.
